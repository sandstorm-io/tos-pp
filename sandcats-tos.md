# Terms of Service

The following terms apply to your use of the Sandstorm Sandcats DNS service ("the service"), as offered by the Sandstorm project ("we"/"us").

These terms do not apply to users running the Sandstorm open source software under their own domain name. Use of the Sandstorm software on your own server (whether under sandcats.io or your own domain) is covered by [the Sandstorm license](https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/blob/master/LICENSE).

## What you may do with the services

The Sandcats service provides DNS (allowing people to locate your server's IP address given the name you choose for it) and TLS certificates (allowing people to establish a secure (private and authenticated) connection to your server) to people running a Sandstorm server.

You may use the Sandcats service in conjunction with a server running an up-to-date version of Sandstorm. Sandcats is closely integrated with Sandstorm. As the service's protocols may change over time, it is important that you keep your Sandstorm installation up-to-date. We recommend enabling automatic updates, but if you do not, please update within a month of any new release. If your Sandstorm installation becomes out-of-date, or your server is not running Sandstorm at all, the service may cease to function.

## Prohibited activity

* You may not use the service for activities that are illegal under United States law.
* You may not use the service to facilitate online harassment campaigns, regardless of legality. "Online harassment" means activity meant to threaten, bully, or otherwise maliciously make life difficult for an individual person or class of people, especially (but not limited to) women and minorities.
* You may not choose a hostname that is intended to deceive others about the server's content, such as for the purposes of spam, phishing, or otherwise.

If we, in our sole discretion, determine that you are using Sandcats in a way that violates these rules, we may stop providing service for your Sandcats subdomain. If we take such an action, we will e-mail you at the address you provided upon registering your subdomain (unless we are prohibited by law from doing so). For minor violations (in our sole judgment), we may notify you in advance to give you a chance to correct the problem before we take action.

## Law Enforcement Actions

We will only reveal your data to law enforcement when we believe we are legally required to do so, such as by a court order. If this occurs, we will notify you, unless we are legally prohibited from doing so.

## Cancellation

You may end your service at any time by stopping your Sandstorm server or reconfiguring it not to use Sandcats. If you wish for us to explicitly delete your last-known IP address and email address from our database, please contact us at [support@sandstorm.io](mailto:support@sandstorm.io).

## Changes to service

We reserve the right to modify or discontinue the service at any time. If possible we will give 30 days' notice before discontinuing existing functionality.

## Problems and Contact

All problems should be reported by emailing [support@sandstorm.io](mailto:support@sandstorm.io), except for security problems, which should be reported to [security@sandstorm.io](mailto:security@sandstorm.io).

## Copyright and Trademark Issues

To notify Sandstorm of a copyright or trademark violation, please contact [copyright@sandstorm.io](mailto:copyright@sandstorm.io) or [trademark@sandstorm.io](mailto:trademark@sandstorm.io), respectively.

Please note that we do not host any content via the Sandcats service; it only points to other people's servers. We cannot control the content of those servers. If the infringing content is on a Sandcats user's server, you will need to contact them directly.

## Miscellaneous

As with any agreement, our lawyers said there are additional provisions necessary to explain our relationship.  Read these carefully.
