# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy describes in detail how the Sandstorm Sandcats DNS service ("the service"), as run by the Sandstorm project ("we"/"us"), protects your privacy.

These terms do not apply to users running the Sandstorm open source software under their own domain name. Use of the Sandstorm software on your own server (whether under sandcats.io or your own domain) is covered by [the Sandstorm license](https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Introduction

The Sandcats service provides DNS (allowing people to locate your computer's IP address given the name you choose for it) and TLS certificates (allowing people to establish a secure (private and authenticated) connection to your server) to people running a Sandstorm server.

## Data gathered from you, and how we use it

When you run a Sandstorm server that uses Sandcats, the service gathers these pieces of information about you:

* Your server's IP address. This address will be published to the world via the DNS protocol, as is the purpose of the service.
* Your email address. We will use this address to contact you with service issues if needed and to help you recover a lost hostname, or to notify you of changes to the terms of service or privacy policy. We will not share this address with anyone unless required by law, in which case we will notify you unless prohibited by law.
* Your chosen Sandcats subdomain. Although we do not actively publish a directory of Sandcats hostnames, this name may appear in certificate transparency reports and other public places.

## Data gathered by other users' servers

When you visit a subdomain of sandcats.io, you are visiting someone else's server. This server is not controlled by us. You will need to consult that server's own privacy policy to determine how it may use your data.

## Data Storage Location

All data we collect is stored in the United States on servers at our infrastructure service provider, Google Cloud Services, which stores this data encrypted at rest. Google Cloud Services' [Terms of Service](https://cloud.google.com/terms/), section 5, states that Google will use data stored through the service only to deliver the service; data will not be used in conjunction with Google's other products, including advertising products. Additional details regarding Google Cloud Services' compliance as a data processor and their practices for data deletion and security can be found in their [Data Processing and Security Terms](https://cloud.google.com/terms/data-processing-terms).

## Cancellation and data deletion

You may end your service at any time by stopping your Sandstorm server or reconfiguring it not to use Sandcats. If you wish for us to explicitly delete your last-known IP address and email address from our database, please contact us at [support@sandstorm.io](mailto:support@sandstorm.io).

## Effective Date

This policy is effective as of July 1, 2022.
